# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful?
It will be useful when you want to make changes to each element in an array or sift through a long array list and find answers quickly.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need to practice using the each method with if statements. I will create a few strings of arrays and practice different conditional if statements with them.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment?
Reading through what you can do with each and going back to how you find the length of a variable in our previous practice.
